# send_email
This is very simple python script to send email via your gmail account. This can be used with Raspberry Pi and its camera module.
You have to make sure you enable "Less secure app access" under security of your gmail account.
There is good youtube video to explain this --> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-NYmDWiFjU
